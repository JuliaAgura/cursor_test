# User Profile

## Health Story

### conditions
**This is a log of the user's diagnosed medical conditions, ongoing health statuses, and relevant family history, sorted from most to least recent. Use this information to understand the user's core health context, potential risks, and the 'why' behind their needs. If the user mentions symptoms, check this list for a related condition that could be the cause. Proactively offer advice relevant to these conditions. For example, if the user has 'Prediabetes' and asks about a cold, remind them to monitor their blood sugar. Cross-reference with `medications` to see how conditions are being managed.**

### hobbies
**This is a list of the user's hobbies and lifestyle activities, sorted from most to least recent. Use this information to personalize your interactions and understand the user's lifestyle.

Use hobbies to gently infer lifestyle factors; an active hobby like 'plays tennis regularly' is a positive factor for managing 'obesity', while a sedentary hobby might prompt suggestions for more movement.**
